# Q1 Define diff types of Variable
# a,b,c = 1,2.5,"Task 1"
# print(a,b,c)

# Q2 Swap complex to int variable types and value
# complexVar = 20 + 4j
# print(type(complexVar))
# intVar = 10

# complexVar, intVar = intVar, complexVar

# print ("Converted Complex:", complexVar)
# print ("Converted Int:", intVar)

# Q3 Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.

############## Part 1 ###############
# x = 5
# y = 7
 
# print ("Before swapping: ")
# print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)
 
# x, y = y, x
 
# print ("After swapping: ")
# print("Value of x : ", x, " and y : ", y)

# Q3 Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.

############## Part 2 ###############

# x = 5
# y = 10

# temp = x
# x = y
# y = temp

# print('The value of x after swapping: {}'.format(x))
# print('The value of y after swapping: {}'.format(y))

# Q4 Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.xVersion.

# userInput = input( )
# print ("Your entered text is: ", userInput)

# Q5. Write a program to complete the task given below:
#     Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 ,
#     add the two numbers and keep the sum inanother variable called z.
#     Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as thefinal output.

# numFirst = int(input("Please enter any one number between 1 to 10 :" ))
# numSecond = int(input("Please enter second number between 1 to 10 :" ))

# z = numFirst + numSecond
# result = z + 30
# print("The final output:", result)

# 6.Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
# HINT: Printed output should say -The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc

# enterd_value = type(eval(input("Enter something: " )))

# print(enterd_value)

# 7.Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase andUPPERCASE.

# lower_camel = 23
# Upper_Camel = 34
# snake_case = 45
# UPPER_CASE = 23

# 8.If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’again.
#   Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
# --> Yes, "a" will become a holder of latest value allocation.
