# 5.Go through the link provided below to understand finally and raise concept
# :https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exception-handling

# As per my understanding Finally will print in every condition regardless what is written in Try and Except blocks.
# Raise can be use in Try block for predefine existing error handling like ValueError and more and we can modify our custome message in ("")after declaring raise and name of error.
